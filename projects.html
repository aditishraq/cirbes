                    <h2>Implementing Internet of Things to Create a Circular Industrial Symbiosis System (CIS Sotenäs)</h2>
                    <p>To achieve the goals of Circular Economy it is necessary that the loop of the information in an industrial system is also closed in parallel to closing the loop of the resources. With this ambition, CirBES has joined the force with Sotenäs municipality and ten local companies in the west coast of Sweden for 'Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) to Create a Circular Industrial Symbiosis System (CIS Sotenäs)'.</p>
                    <p>The main objective of the project is, through real-time information sharing, increase the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of the Industrial Symbiosis system in Sotenäs. The project has received funding from the strategic innovation program IoT Sweden, a collaborative funding program by Vinnova, Swedish Energy Agency and Formas.</p>
                    <p>In the project, CirBES is offering its knowledge and expertise of implementing circular systems and providing support in developing the IoT platform. CirBES has also taken the role of managing the changes in these organizations that will result due to implementing IoT and establishing the inter-organizational collaboration.</p>

                    <h2>Material Passport: A digital platform for manufacturing industry to implement Circular Production Systems (CEPort)</h2>
                    <p>Transition towards Circular Economy through implementing Circular Production Systems (CPS) has become inevitable to mitigate challenges of resource scarcity and resource price volatility as well as ensure sustainable development. One of the challenges with implementation of CPS is to ensure integration and flow of information across the value chains so that right value recovery activities can be performed efficiently.</p>
                    <p>CirBES in corporation with a cross functional group of researchers, manufacturers, software developers and recycling experts is assessing the applicability of a digital platform that can enable generating material passports to facilitate implementation of CPS through a project funded by VINNOVA, the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
                    <p>The platform will establish connection between different value chain actors and enable them to share product and material information throughout multiple lifecycle of products. In this project, CirBES is providing its expertise in laying a foundation for the platform development to provide support for product compliance by increasing the transparency across value chain actors.</p>
